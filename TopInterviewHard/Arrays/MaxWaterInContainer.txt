/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

[1] -> 0
[1,2] -> 1
[] -> 0
[1,2,4,1] -> 1+2+1 = 4
[1,8,5,8,1] -> 1+5+5+3+3+1 = 18
