Prefix sum:
1. Sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries
   sum[i, j] = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/description/?source=submission-ac -- balanced binary subarray

Monotonic stack :
1. next greater element
for i in range(n):
  while st and arr[i] > arr[st[-1]]:
    result[st.pop()] = arr[i]
  st.append(i)
return result
2. daily temp
