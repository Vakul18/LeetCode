"""
Given an undirected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented by 2d array edges[][], where edges[i]=[u,v] represents the edge between the vertices u and v. Determine whether a specific edge between two vertices (c, d) is a bridge.

Note:

An edge is called a bridge if removing it increases the number of connected components of the graph.
if thereâ€™s only one path between c and d (which is the edge itself), then that edge is a bridge.
